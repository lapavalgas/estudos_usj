<!-- 
        This represent my first complete web project and I focus in CSS and Jekyll. 
        In four days I did my finest to catch some the best practices in CSS. 
        Now, I move to JavaEE and server-side. 
        But I need focus on my master degree too :/      
        :)

        So,
                if (you_can_understand && like_this) { 
                    return: you_can_hiring_me(please); 
                } else {
                    Thank you by your time to look at this. 
                    I'll accept any suggestion. 
                }
                Bye bye.
